## Material for the *R* [*tidyverse*](https://www.tidyverse.org/) workshop (May 16-17-18, 2018).

The workshop is intended mainly for first-year PhDs in Economics, but all *CoMoS* modellers are welcome to attend!

The workshop covers topics on data science throughout a typical research project. No prior knowledge of *R* is required! Hopefully even those of you familiar with “base R” (but not the tidyverse) will find something new.

The material is based on [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. See also their book
[*R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data *](https://www.amazon.it/dp/1491910399) published by O'Reilly Media, 2017.

## Schedule (TBC)

Date | Time | Room 
--|-- | --
Wednesday 16/06/2018 | 10:30–12:30 | Aula 3 Toscanelli
Thursday 17/06/2018 | 10:30–12:30 | Aula 3 Toscanelli
Friday 18/06/2018 | 10:30–12:30 | Aula 3 Toscanelli

## Tentative outline:
* __Data input in R__: importing data from “messy” files, reading common and exotic formats and directory structures; preserving metadata; web scraping.
* __Data wrangling in R__: “tidying” strategies for fixing common issues with data; text processing with regular expressions; reshaping (wide-long) tabular data; merging and appending data.
* __Visualization__: plot data with *ggplot2*; principles and recipes for visualization.
* __Automation__: using the pipe `%>%`;  automate tasks with functional programming with *purrr*.
* __Statistical modeling__: automated approaches to estimation and model selection.


## Preparation
Please bring your laptop and charger with [*R*](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [*RStudio*](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed.

Try to install *tidyverse* in *R* as well:

```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
